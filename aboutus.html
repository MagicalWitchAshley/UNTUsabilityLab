					<h3>Information Experience Laboratory</h3>
					
					<p>The College of Information at the University of North Texas is proud to announce the new usability laboratory. The goal of this new facility is to create an environment where data can be gathered effectively by testing, observing and evaluating human interaction with a digital environment. There are many services offered in the lab, listed below.</p>
					<p>The usability lab is open for both academic and commercial purposes. Students and staff of UNT, as well as university partners, are welcome to use the UI lab for projects at no cost. The lab is also open to the public for a small rental fee.</p>
					<p>The usability lab is located within the Discovery Park campus for UNT. It is operated by the School of Information Science within the College of Information, led by Xin Wang, the head lecturer on Usability and User Experience Research at the university. A team of trained students working to earn their degree in Information Science operate the lab.</p>

					<h3>Services, Methods, and Expertise</h3>
					<p>Below are the services, methods and expertise offered by UNT IE lab:</p>
					
					<div class="indent">
					<p>1.	Usability Testing Services: Usability Testing makes a reference to assessing an item or administration by testing it with representative clients. This type of software testing incorporates testing User Interfaces (UI) and User Experience (UX). From a client's perspective, it is more suitable and better to utilize a software application which is hassle free, user- friendly and unique. These days, making anything easy to understand, extraordinary, and bother free applications is the most important thing. To assist associations with accomplishing these objectives, convenience testing is executed.</p>
					<p>2.	Usability Testing Stages: The main two stages of usability testing are Summative Test and Formative Test. Formative tests are performed to derive quick insights where users’ comments through their emotions, confusion sources and their reasons for actions. Secondly, Summative tests are performed to capture metrics where usability of a product is validated. The results of the test determine user’s success rate in achieving goal and evaluating time spent on completing a task.</p>
					<p>3.	IE Lab Tools: Our IE lab is well-equipped place where We perform usability tests for mobile apps & websites using the most useful usability testing tools such as, Treejack, CrazyEgg, Optimizely, ClickTale, Usabilla, Keynote, UserZoom, web-based survey software, etc.</p>
					<p>4.	IE Lab Team Expertise: Our team conduct testing services in real world conditions and environment to record, study and examine the real-time performance and experience of the users. Our team make sure that the designers has understood how to make better designs by providing valuable suggestions and recommendations.</p>

				<h3>Our Mission</h3>
				<p>The mission of the University of North Texas Usability Lab is to optimize UX design, workflows and to create certain research experience. It makes the level of learning, adapting and understanding the application much easier. Since laboratory testing supplements realistic task, it is important to check the design of the application or the site and to make sure it is convenient and simple for user. It combines the conventional usability assessment with the information regarding client experience, human data exploration and socio-specialized combination plan. The IE Lab provided service to a client across Texas, including different organizations, corporate offices, non-profit organizations and other academic partners. The IE Lab is operated by the College of Information at the University of North Texas and consists of the Director of Research and several doctoral students, who are trained as usability researchers.</p>

				<h3>Laboratory Equipment and Resources</h3>
				<p>The usability lab at the University of North Texas offers a variety of equipment and resources to gather data on user interaction.</p>
				<p>In the observation room, the researcher is able to view in real time on two large monitors. The software used by the lab records the on-screen activity as well as the details of how users interact with the computer, including keystrokes and mouse clicks. Eye-tracking hardware is also utilized to give the researcher more insight on the user’s interaction with the design of the information environment. A webcam on the user’s computer records the user directly as they interact with the digital information. The one-way mirror allows the researcher to observe the test subjects while three cameras record sessions. The cameras are placed to capture multiple angles: from behind the user, to the right of the user and directly above the user to focus on the keyboard, mouse and written materials.</p>
				<p>The team is also able to conduct user studies either in the room with the test subject(s) or from behind the glass over a microphone and speakers. These user studies include interviews, focus groups and think aloud testing. Testing can be scripted, either by the party requesting the test or by the lab staff.</p>
				<p>All sessions include pre- and post-test questioning in order to provide user satisfaction results and recommendations to improve the tested environment. The lab will also provide a detailed analysis of usability results and a DVD of the session.</p>
